- [Agenda and Ideas](https://www.solutionsiq.com/learning/blog-post/agenda-and-ideas/) - by Tony Bonfante. "The following is a recommended agenda for a 1 hour Retrospective. There are different formulas out there for retrospective time per weeks in the sprint. 1 hour to 1-1/2 hours for a 2-week sprint should serve quite well. If you engage your soft skills of scanning the room and leading from behind, you’ll be able to judge what’s best for your team. If the activities are tightly run without rambling discussions, 1 hour should work fine for a standard team of 6-9 members. You’ll get better results if you keep things fairly fast paced, so lean towards a shorter versus a longer meeting and keep things moving. Your team will thank you for getting to a quick conclusion."
